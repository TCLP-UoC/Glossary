# Glossary
TCLP's glossary contains standard climate-related definitions to help legal professionals draft climate-conscious contracts.
The Glossary is the focus of a wider project to deign and build a user centred system for creating, maintaining and updating TCLP's content. 
This will involve creating user personas, user stories, identifying system requirements for a component page to display the Glossary.
